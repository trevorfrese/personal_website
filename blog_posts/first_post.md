I started programming when I was 12. I had grown up playing video games. I got
a Nintendo 64 when I was young and played Mario 64, Super Smash Brothers,
Perfect Dark, GoldenEye, and Bomberman 64. 

When I entered middle school I got my own computer and used it almost exclusively 
for gaming. I played Maplestory and Runescape with my friends. These games 
were really fun and so I decided to make my own video games. In the process,
I learned Actionscript and Flash. I was mostly just copying and pasting
tutorials into my editor and seeing what games would pop out.

The majority of how I learned to code back then was the modifications of 
working code tutorials. I would see an "Asteroids Video Game Tutorial", 
copy all the relevant code into my editor, and then tweak variables so that
the ship was a different color, or make it so that the winning conditions
were altered.

I then became really interested in pixelated drawings and started making
pixelated drawings and sprites for my video games.
